# Hola! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Profile

My goal as an aspiring professional in Software Development is to continue to grow by being adaptive and malleable to new ideas and willingness to learn new concepts. My greatest aspiration is to have a meaningful career as a Software developer where I can learn to think effectively as a developer and mostly to interact and learn from other professional developers.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning P.E.R.N. Fullstack JavaScript Development
